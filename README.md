### **Problem Statement**

**Title: Science/Technology Categorization Using BERT**

**Objective:**
Develop a text classification model using BERT to categorize news articles into two predefined categories based on their content. The classifier should effectively classify news articles into one of the following categories: Non-Tech/Non-Science or Science/Technology.

**Background:**
The AG News dataset contains a diverse range of news articles spanning multiple categories. Accurately classifying news articles helps in organizing and presenting information efficiently, enhancing user experience in news aggregation platforms and content management systems.

**Data:**
- **Training Data**: A dataset of 1958 news articles labeled with one of the four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology. The articles have been preprocessed, tokenized, and padded to a uniform length of 55 tokens.
- **Test Data**: A separate dataset of 7600 news articles, similarly preprocessed, to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
